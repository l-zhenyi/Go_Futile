# Go_Futile
## There is no other way this ends.
I created a text-based game using Golang and Ebitengine. I drew inspiration from artwork and this quote:<br>
"You cannot save her. She will always die. You cannot save her. She will always die. You cannot save her. 
She will always die. You cannot save her. She will always die, but i have to try."



## How to Run

To play the game, you'll need Go installed.  Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go run main.go
