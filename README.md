I created a text-based game using Golang and Ebitengine. I drew inspiration from the myth of Orpehus and Eurydice, the song _We're In Love_ by Boygenius and this quote:<br>
"You cannot save her. She will always die. You cannot save her. She will always die. You cannot save her. 
She will always die. You cannot save her. She will always die, but i have to try."

This game should take less than 10-minutes to play and it was a fun project to familiarise myself with Golang and how game engines work in general.
