# Go_Futile
#### There is no other way this ends.
I created a text-based game using Golang and Ebitengine. I drew inspiration from this quote:<br>
"You cannot save her. She will always die. You cannot save her. She will always die. You cannot save her. 
She will always die. You cannot save her. She will always die, but i have to try."

It takes less than 10-minutes to play and was a fun project to familiarise myself with Golang and how game engines work in general.


## Installation and Running Instructions
Prequisites: Golang, Ebitengine
